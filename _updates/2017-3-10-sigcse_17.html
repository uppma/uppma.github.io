title: "Great fun teaching kiddos data science!"

Had a fun presentation and a teaching session at SIGCSE 2017! <a href="http://datasciencekids.org/search/label/seattle-camp" target="_blank">[details]</a> Good conference to meet enthu high school CS teachers. But we may need better/serious conferences to discuss pedagogy and teaching tools in advanced undergraduate topics in CS.
